:raised_hands: :raised_hands: :raised_hands: Welcome to my personal page!

I am now a 5th-year Ph.D. student at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/).
Previously, I graduated with a bachelor’s degree in 2020 from the School of Microelectronics and Communication Engineering at [Chongqing University](https://www.cqu.edu.cn/).

My representative open-source projects include:  
- (1) [FaceChain ![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/modelscope/FaceChain?style=social&label=Stars)](https://github.com/modelscope/facechain) (a popular framework for generating identity-preserved human portraits); 
- (2) [TransFace ![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/DanJun6737/TransFace?style=social&label=Stars)](https://github.com/DanJun6737/TransFace) (a cutting-edge face representation extractor in the AIGC era);


My current research interests include:
- 1️⃣ 🌟🌟🌟 AIGC: identity-preserved human portraits generation, and face-centric perception & understanding model;
- 2️⃣ Face Perception and Understanding: face recognition, face representation learning, and facial attribute recognition;
- 3️⃣ Data-Centric AI: the development of efficient transformer architectures;
- 4️⃣ Transfer Learning: unsupervised/semi-supervised domain adaptation, graph domain adaptation, and domain generalization.


<!-- My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->
